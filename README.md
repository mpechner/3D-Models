3D-Models
=========
I wanted to create a breadboard that the 3 fives kits could sit in.  Notes, plat with the tempurature.  You print this big holes (top view) down.  The arch need the correct temp to stick.   Also, you'll need to tell the slicer you use that the inmage is in inches.  Otherwise you will  open it and see a tiny object.  

I designed this using Autodesk 360.  The f3d is a archive of the project.

You can also send me an email at mikey@mikey.com and I will share the project with you through fusion 360.
