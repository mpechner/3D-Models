Me and a friend have a filistruder, http://www.filastruder.com/.

The hopper craked and we do not want to disassemble the whole thing to replace it.  

So I took the original hopper file found here: http://www.soliforum.com/topic/2036/filastruder-documentation-and-cadstl-files/

I Modded it so that it is in two peices and can be replaced without disassembly.
